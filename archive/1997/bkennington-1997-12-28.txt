To friends of Raphael A. Lafferty:

I am a cousin of Ray's who is helping him keep track of his bills and
correspondence. The mail to 1715 S. Trenton, Tulsa, OK is being
forwarded to my address, so I received your card or letter and sent
it to him. But I noted your return address so I could let you know
Ray's current residence:

<b>Franciscan Villa Health Care Center J-54
17110 E. 51st Street South
Broken Arrow, OK 74012</b>

He moved there after some health problems that needed more care than
he could get at home. He is doing well, and I'm sure would appreciate
hearing from you. Please understand if he is not able to reply to your
messages. I would be happy to help if you need to contact him.

Thanks for your mail.

Sincerely
Betsy Kennington

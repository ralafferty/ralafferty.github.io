I knew Mr. Lafferty slightly when I lived in Tulsa. Mr. Lafferty always attended 7:30 AM Mass on Sunday at Christ the King Church. He lived 3 blocks away on St. Louis Street with his sister Pauline. He walked to and from Mass, and sometimes, if in the mood, would accept my offer of a ride. He was reticent, but did love to talk about travelling to SF conventions. He was as interesting to me as were his stories, and I am sorry I did not know him better. His stories were always touched by aspects of Oklahoma that might not be apparent to someone who never lived there.

I wanted to post this for anyone intersted. I am glad there is continued interest in Mr. Lafferty's writings, as he is the only SF writer that has held my interest over the years.

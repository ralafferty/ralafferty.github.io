Just spotted this blog/forum. I'll try to assist/clarify on some things. I live in Tulsa. Used to put on a local SF convention here called ConJuration. Laff was a guest at every one. I've had the pleasure to speak to him several times in the 1980s. Arrive at Easterwine was a collection of three shorter stories. that's why it seems to have a triple-esque. Laff said, when I asked him specifically about world-endings, that it was the creation of the post-modern world that signaled the "end" of the previous one. One of his non-fict pieces (I have a Drumm copy around there somewhere) makes it clear that he felt the post-modern, post-war world was "flat." Unproductive. Unappealing. Unimaginative. I own a pretty comprehensive library of his works and might be able to answer other questions. Hope this helps, and for what it's worth. P. Benton, T-Town, Oklahoma.

Daniel, AaE started as three separate stories about the Institute for Impure Science, complete with all the familiar characters. I told him, while picking him up to attend to ConJ II, that I'd had trouble following the storyline of AaE. His reply was that it was 3 tales strung together into a loose-knit whole. Without really knowing for certain, I got the impression that his agent was desirous of a full-length novel in the SF field, and the common characters enabled the 3 otherwise disparate stories to be combined. Laff was, to me at least, a very quiet and reserved man. He'd answer questions if presented with them, but was often more of a seeming observer than participant in things. It's been said that he was an "author's author." I can verify that. ConJuration brought in SF authors from all over, old and new. Ed Bryant, Jack Chalker, Algis Budrys, and couple dozen others whose names I've since forgotten. All of them wanted to meet Laff, and most, came away with boxes full of Laff's titles after meeting with him. He sat in on a number of panel discussions, though he remained a quiet man for the most part. Glad to be a part of the discussion here--Laff is the most unappreciated writer ever, and, for my money, he is, hands-down the best.

I am not familiar with many of Lafferty's books, but I know that the people who post here are, the reason I am posting is because my wife is a nurse who takes care of R.A. Lafferty, here in Broken Arrow, OK in a local nursing home. It was only recently that I began to look into his writings to learn more about him. If there is anything that I might be able to do to help any big fans here, let me know, I will do my best, thanks.

We have relayed the messages for those who inquired, to Mr. Lafferty and he is very thankful. Although he is currently in a state where he needs assistance for those things that the rest of us take for granted in our daily routine, he also seems to be doing quite well. One thing that I thought was humorous that my wife said, was that he would rather be pampered than do some things himself which he IS capable- I suppose this is one of the benefits of age! She also thought it funny that his nickname was the grumpy old man from Tulsa- very appropriate she says, but very nice when he wants to be!

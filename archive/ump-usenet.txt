THE LAFFERTY BOOKLET SERIES

   The Lafferty booklet series pulled together rare and previously
unpublished or uncollected short stories, poetry, and essays.  Many of
the booklets were nominated for small press awards and recommended by
such luminaaries as David Hartwell, Michael Swanwick, and Gardner
Dozois in "Years Best" lists.


CHAPBOOKS
---------

THE EARLY LAFFERTY (CHAPBOOK)
           Just what is says.  The very first stories, not all of which
are science fiction, but all of which are unmistakably Lafferty.
These came from places as widely divergent as the New Mexico Quarterly
Review and certain obscure "Men's" magazines from 1959-61.  Six
Stories, 28 pages.
$3.50, Signed $6.50.

THE EARLY LAFFERTY II (CHAPBOOK)
           More of the same.  THe first collection was so popular that it
encouraged the offering of a second volume. Six more stories, 32 pages
$4.50, Signed $7.50

PROMONTORY GOATS (CHAPBOOK)
           An original novelette (8000+ words) set in the author's ARGO

into the claims by Kasmir "Casey" Szymansky's that he is the
Antichrist.  24 pages.
$3.50, Signed $6.50

TRUE BELIEVERS (CHAPBOOK)

HOW MANY MILES TO BABYLON? (CHAPBOOK)
           Like the "Promontory Goats" story, this 36 page novella
(15,000+ words) is set in the ARGO universe where the Church has gone
underground and the move is on to find a new Pope to replace the one
that has just been executed! Wildly different.

STRANGE SKIES (CHAPBOOK)

together poetry and verse from a half dozen unpublished novels as well

various SF holy cows.  A fun read.

I went to the funeral chapel to pay my respects to R.A. Lafferty. The one item there that was not part of the "standard" funeral things was the accolade that is on this board that was written by Robert Reginald. I considered it a matter of great respect.

I will be going to the funeral (mass) tomorrow.

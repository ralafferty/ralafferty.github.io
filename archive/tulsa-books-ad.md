R. A. Lafferty was a [Tulsa science-fiction writer](http://thislandpress.com/11/05/2014/lafferty-lost-and-found/?read=complete) who wrote more than 200 stories and 20 novels. 

Hailed as a [genius](/#quotes) by his peers, no one has since matched his unique writing style.

His [personal library](/library) of 8,000 books was sold without being cataloged. 

The names of Lafferty's lost books are important to literary scholars. 

Many of his books had contact tape on their spine (see photo).

Subject: [RALafferty] help

I'm working on a new essay about Lafferty, somewhat different from the
one I wrote for Readercon. This one is for a select group of mainstream
literary readers who I am assuming know nothing about Lafferty. The
goal is to get them to want to read Lafferty. I'd like to know if
anyone could read this and see what you think. It's not going to be
posted on the web, so I'm just inserting the text here. In particular,
I hope someone will let me know if I've said anything really dumb about
Catholicism or St. Augustine; my knowledge of these is fairly
rudimentary. In fact, Lafferty is the only reason I know anything about
Augustine. But I'm assuming that at least some of the audience for this
will be Catholics and might be interested in Lafferty for that reason,
so I don't want to offend anybody. And this is still a little rough.

************************

All right, all right, I've been sitting and staring and this damn
screen for hours and hours trying to answer the unanswerable: How do
you explain R. A. Lafferty to someone who has never read any of his
work? I've been reading Lafferty for years, I published two of his
books, and I can't even explain him to <i>me</i>. One could begin with
jacket-copy clichés, "neglected genius," "a distinctive and unique
American voice," "a visionary plumbing the depths of the human soul,"
but this is a cheap trick and gets you nowhere fast. There is no easy
category or label to stick on the work. The labels slide off, get lost
on the floor. Sure, there are other writers sufficiently original to be
called <i>sui generis</i>, but usually it is not so hard a task to
trace lineages, evolutionary steps, groups of literary compatriots, and
so on; Lafferty is downright anomalous.

Attempting to shoehorn the anomalous into a literary spectrum, I have
seen Lafferty compared to Flann O'Brien, Franz Kafka, Flannery
O'Connor, Philip K. Dick, G. K. Chesterton, James Joyce, Gabriel García
Márquez, and more (to borrow a quote from Don Webb: "The astute
observer will note that all the names on the list are Irish, saving
those which are not."). I am responsible for some of these myself. But
here I would like to emphasize Lafferty's distinctions rather than his
resemblences to others. Because of Lafferty's unusual literary
position, there isn't very much in the way of critical writing about
him; what follows is little more than a few signposts into relatively
uncharted territory.

Yes, most of his stories appeared in science fiction markets, and were
often called such, but they were not products of the genre. If this
were the case, if Lafferty had simply written amusing stories about
weird things, myself and my colleagues would not have struggled so hard
and at such cost to keep him from being forgotten.

Perhaps we should begin with the superficial facts of the matter, so
that they may be dismissed. R. A. Lafferty's stories began to appear in
1959, when Lafferty was forty-five years old. At the time, he was
working for the Clark Electrical Supply company of Tulsa, Oklahoma. But
heavy drinking was starting affect his health, and in order to cut
down, he looked for something to fill the time. He turned to writing,
trying his hand at writing a variety of different types of short
stories, and found that the science fiction magazines would buy what he
sent.

Most sf writers start young and read extensively within the field;
Lafferty started in middle age and knew almost nothing about it. The
writers he would cite as influences—Chesterton, Belloc, Twain,
Melville, Stevenson, Dickens, Balzac—were mostly of the nineteenth
century. He was not the least bit modern by inclination or outlook.
This would seem to be a handicap for an sf writer, but Ray turned it to
great advantage. He did have a few other resources to draw on, and the
one that influenced his style and method the most was the rich
tradition of tall-tale storytelling that was still vibrant and strong
in Oklahoma at the beginning of the twentieth century.

In the 1890s, the Cherokee Outlet of Oklahoma was the last frontier,
the last large tract of land made available for homesteading by federal
grant. Settlers poured into it and made towns and farms and businesses
literally overnight. As a boy, Ray spent many nights listening to
stories being spun out by men he considered master storytellers. His
uncle, Ed Burke, worked as a stenographer at the Wichita Indian Agency,
and Ray learned a good bit of Native American folklore from him.

Lafferty relates in an interview that while working as a buyer for
Clark, his job brought him into contact with dozens of salesmen, and
that he picked up many good stories from them. "Salesmen," he said,
"are the best storytellers." And indeed there is a quality to
Lafferty's tone that could be described as hucksterish, the voice of
the fast-talking carnival barker trying to get the rubes to take a peek
into the tent with promises of wonders and miracles. But Lafferty views
his marks not with disdain but with great sympathy, and while he is
dazzling you with wonders and miracles the real prize has been quietly
slipped into your back pocket to be discovered later.

Lafferty makes extensive use of the breezy, colloquial feel of the oral
style, the high humor and the piling up of whoppers one after another.
In fact, the best way to appreciate Lafferty's voice is to read the
story out loud to somebody else.

Lafferty used the techniques of the tall-tale storyteller, but the
content came from inside Lafferty's own head. In particular, his
dreams. In an interview, Lafferty said he would "get a lot of ideas out
of dreams. . . . It seems useless to try to analyze them. But I've some
odd dreams, and when I embody them into a story, I don't have them
anymore."

In a dream, you may see someone you know, but they look different from
their waking appearance. In a dream, you may see someone who looks like
someone you know, but is someone else. In a dream, perspectives shift
suddenly, objects become larger or smaller, sequences of events are
nonlinear and not necessarily causally connected. Things and people
project emotional resonances not visibly apparent. All of this and more
may occur in a Lafferty story, simultaneously with the waking reality,
to the confusion of the characters, and often the reader as well.

This might lead one to call Lafferty a surrealist, though Lafferty
himself shied away from this tag: "I don't regard myself as a
Surrealist in the sense of the Surrealist Manifesto published by Andre
Breton in 1924. To me, that Manifesto is somewhat dated, being a recoil
from World War One, and being too heavily Freudian. My own unconscious
is more Jungian than Freudian. . . . I suppose I believe in another
sort of surreality or super-reality, but it would have to be on a wider
basis than the encounters of myself and me. As often as not, it is my
subconscious that supplies the rational element, and the exterior world
that supplies the dream and fantasy feeling."

Lafferty frequently presents the exterior world of his stories as being
superficially like our consensus reality, with an intrusion of some
anomalous event. But upon investigation, it is shown that the strange
event is not so unique, that it has happened in the past and may happen
again in the future. And so the world is transformed from a place where
these events are impossible to one where the events are possible, but
the possibility is hidden from normal view.

Now we come closer to the heart of the matter.

What was all this for? Ray Lafferty was a devout, conservative Roman
Catholic. Humans, in Lafferty's view, had a privileged position in the
world, but it was a position that could be lost, or taken away, or
usurped by another. Quite a few of his stories involve characters
caught between alternating views of reality, one of which is
approximately like our waking reality and one which is more surreal, or
more primal, and ending up on the right side depends on making a choice
about what's necessary for our essential humanity.

As a boy in Tulsa, Lafferty was sent to the Cascia Hall Preparatory
School, a private Catholic school. The central text of the religious
education at Cascia Hall was St. Augustine's <i>City of God</i> (Cascia
Hall still bills itself as "an Augustinian School"). Augustine's vision
of two societies, one of which was ruled by God and made up of the
faithful (and other entities) who accepted God, and the other an
earthly society, concerned with secular things, ruled by Satan, clearly
affected Lafferty deeply. Visions of the conflict between these two
societies recur frequently in many forms (both overt and hidden) in
Lafferty's stories and novels.

In a speech given in 1981, Lafferty explained his view that the world
was not coming to an end, but that it already had ended. "I am speaking
literally about a real happening, the end of the world in which we
lived until fairly recent years. The destruction or unstructuring of
that world, which is still sometimes referred to as 'Western
Civilization' or 'Modern civilization', happened suddenly, some time in
the half century between 1912 and 1962. That world, which was 'the
World' for a few centuries, is gone." He then goes on to state that
structured prose fiction is dead, and that "we are now in an
unstructured era of post-musical music, post-fictional fiction, and
post-experiential experience. We are, partly at least, in a
post-conscious world. Most people seem to prefer to live in this world
that has lost a dimension. I don't know whether the condition is
permanent or transitory." And indeed, there were a lot of big changes
in the early decades of the 20th century, in art, music, science
(relativity and quantum mechanics), psychology (Freudian theory), and
politics (the unraveling of the old imperial order of Europe). What Ray
says in his essay is that in our new structureless time we're free to
do whatever we want, but that most people prefer grubbing about in the
rubble to using their creativity to build new structures for a new
world.

Given Ray's Augustinian vision, his distaste (to put it mildly) of
secular humanism, and his view of the world as having become without
values or direction, I think it is fair to say that Lafferty saw his
writing as a means to help people find their way to a new society, a
society ruled by moral principles. Lafferty had a strong, traditional
moral vision, and he largely rejected the liberalism and modernism that
he perceived as eroding necessary distinctions. But it wasn't
particularly strict--his characters like to drink, gamble, and carouse,
in a very Old West, frontier way. There are things that are true, and
things that are false, and if sometimes it is unclear which is which,
it is because those of us who think we are awake and perceiving reality
as it is are actually asleep, stumbling around in the dark and missing
half the show.

The other half of the show is often what goes on inside of us when
we're not looking. External appearance is unimportant to Lafferty, only
the mind and soul really count. In Lafferty stories, machines,
dolphins, elephants, bears, monkeys, australopithecines, and dolls
stuffed with sawdust may all be moral actors. Truth may be revealed in
the smallest and seemingly irrelevant detail, because nothing is in
truth too small or irrelevant.

If Lafferty's stories seem at times irrational and surreal, it is not
because he disdained rationality as such, but the impulse of 'rational'
people to try to deny the great and powerful processes that went on
underneath, the processes that connect us to our souls. The worst sin
is to <i>not care.</i> This, to Lafferty, was the ultimate evil, a
suppression of our real human natures, and a kind of slavery and
greying of the world.

This looks solid so far. I've printed off a copy to look at in more
detail, just so my neck and eyeballs don't freeze in place from
trying to read serious copy on the monitor!

Fortunately, I have to go in for office hours tomorrow. Since
students almost never show up for these before the snow starts to
fly, that gives me a couple of uninterrupted hours to look at it.

Just for a start, the Flann O'Brien thing really works. There's even
a similar progression from the brighter comedies like At Swim-Two-
Birds, to the darker ones like The Third Policeman. RAL would
probably have liked the dedication of The Dalkey Archive.

This is true; there are significant similarities on several levels. And
I didn't want to make it sound like Lafferty was so unlike these others
as to be incomprehensible. But I also think saying things like
"Lafferty is like a cross between Twain and O'Brien made to write
science fiction in the 1960s" is not necessarily helpful, either. On
the other hand, The Third Policeman is one of my favorite novels.

Sorry this took longer than expected, but since the Fall, everything
seems to. This is a persuasive essay, but I'm already a convert. I
didn't know some of this information before.

So how do we get people to read RAL? I teach More's Utopia, so every
year I get 1 or 2 people to read Past Master. Beyond that, I don't
know. Many years ago, I spent a couple of weeks reading Fourth
Mansions aloud to my girlfriend. We broke up shortly thereafter, but
I've never blamed Lafferty for that.

Maybe we could reprint some of the short stories and leave them
around in bus stations like religious tracts? (Which, of course, a
lot of them are.)

This really made me think. The way you read RAL, he's a lot like
William Burroughs, except on the side of the angels, and I think
you're right. I'm not a Burroughs fan at all, but they both have the
same take on contemporary society, that the world has already ended.
But Burroughs's solution is to try and destroy his own humanity and
see what happens next. Lafferty really looks at God as the Ultimate
Hipster, but it's easy to miss this because he was never really happy
with any of the versions of Organized Hip that he ran into.

Interesting, also, that both of them were deeply influenced by big
theories of history -- Burroughs by Spengler, Lafferty by St.
Augustine. Both of them also came from great early, Kansas City-
style jazz country (St. Louis and Oklahoma, respectively). Ralph
Ellison came from the same part of the world, and his Invisible Man
is another book that doesn't quite fit into anyone's official view of
the world.

I've actually done that with spare copies of the books.

Lafferty was pretty well read in history--had thousands of history
books in his house--and also read Decline of the West. He said, "Once
you've read that, everything in the world has a different color to it."
The parallel to Burroughs hadn't occurred to me, but I can sort of see
it. Like they're on parallel lines but heading in opposite directions.
Probably some interesting fodder for some future academic there.

Thanks for your feedback.

Another Lafferty parallel might be Dostoyevski. I'm thinking of
Raskolnikov's dream at the end of Crime & Punishment:

"Some new trichinae had appeared, microscopic creatures that lodged
themselves in men's bodies. But these creatures were spirits,
endowed with reason and will. Those who received them into
themselves immediately became possessed and mad. But never, never
had people considered themselves so intelligent and unshakeable in
the truth as did these infected ones. Never had they thought their
judgments, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions and
beliefs more unshakeable. Everyone became anxious, and no one
understood anyone else; each thought the truth was contained in
himself alone, and suffered, looking at others, beat his breast,
wept, and wrung his hands. They did not know whom or how to judge,
could not agree on what to regard as evil, what as good."

This is also the major premise of D's later novel The Possessed. RAL
often says similar things, as in Fourth Mansions.

BTW, did he ever write a follow-up to The Flame Is Green?

Actually, _The Flame of Green_ is the first volume of Lafferty's tetralogy "The Coscuin Chronicles". The second volume, _Half a Sky_,  was also published. However, they are both out of print. The last two, _Sardinian Summer_ and _First and Last Island_, have never been published, but there are manuscripts for both. Hopefully the second half of the tetralogy will one day be published. If the last two volumes are anything like the first two, I believe this tetralogy will go down as R. A. Lafferty's magnum opus.

I'm not expert on Dostoyevski (and It's been a long time since I read
any of it), but as I understand it, some of the religious/philosophical
issues in his books were indeed similar to Lafferty's. I believe he was
a big influence for a number of 20th century Catholic writers, though
how directly he influenced Lafferty I don't know.

When I said he was 'anomalous' I didn't really mean that he was
completely incomprehensible or without precedent. Clearly he had his
influences, and other writers explored similar philosophical paths.
What I meant was that the particular path of his life and literary
career were so unusual that he can be hard to understand from a
conventional literary categorical perspective. To 'get' Lafferty, you
have to be able to let a lot of different things come at you at once,
and not let biases and preconceived notions filter out essential pieces.

There's four volumes in the series, two of which have been published
(the second is Half a Sky). The other two may someday see the light of
day, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it.

Point definitely taken. Lafferty is out to outrage the Official
Culture and the Official Counter-Culture, the hippies and the
straights, at the same time. Which is probably why he still rings
true and doesn't get reprinted.

You might also enjoy Leon Bloy, who was another major-league goof,
and who was the godfather of Jacques and Raissa Maritain.

I will be keeping an eye out for the other volumes in the Flame
series. The present occupant of the Chair of Peter also seems to be
talking like RAL: when we lived in Toronto, I remember a homily at
the Oratorian parish where the priest asked, "If we don't value human
life, then what kind of revolution could we possibly make?"

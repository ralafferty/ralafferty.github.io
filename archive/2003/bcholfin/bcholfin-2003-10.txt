I'm not expert on Dostoyevski (and It's been a long time since I read
any of it), but as I understand it, some of the religious/philosophical
issues in his books were indeed similar to Lafferty's. I believe he was
a big influence for a number of 20th century Catholic writers, though
how directly he influenced Lafferty I don't know.

When I said he was 'anomalous' I didn't really mean that he was
completely incomprehensible or without precedent. Clearly he had his
influences, and other writers explored similar philosophical paths.
What I meant was that the particular path of his life and literary
career were so unusual that he can be hard to understand from a
conventional literary categorical perspective. To 'get' Lafferty, you
have to be able to let a lot of different things come at you at once,
and not let biases and preconceived notions filter out essential pieces.

There's four volumes in the series, two of which have been published
(the second is Half a Sky). The other two may someday see the light of
day, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it.

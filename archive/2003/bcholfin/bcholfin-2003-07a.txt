Perhaps 'apologetics' isn't a good word to use here, and if Ray was
doing it he wasn't doing it consistently. The overtness of the
religious component of his work varied a lot, I think becoming a little
more strident as the years went on. Some of the books (Past Master, of
course) are centered on the battle of religion and secularism, and some
are purely religious allegory (such as Serpent's Egg and East of
Laughter, though these have seen little circulation) of a sort that
maybe Lewis would have written if he'd been Ray Lafferty and not CS
Lewis. But a lot of the stories are not like that at all.

On the other hand, I'm not surprised at all that Hartwell said that.
David likes to have everybody sorted out into neat bins.

Indeed, quite often Lafferty uses the setup of our consensus view of
reality seesawing between two opposing viewpoints ("Dream," "Groaning
Hinges of the World", "days of Grass, Days of Straw", Enniscorthy
Sweeny, etc.) that people have to choose between, or one that must be
actively chosen, and one that is like a default or do-nothing position.
One way represents being more fully human, aware, and alive, the other
is a more degraded state. Often these stories end without the choice
being explicitly made, but with the hint that we're going the wrong way.

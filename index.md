## [Quotes](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/R._A._Lafferty) {#quotes}

> "R. A. Lafferty&hellip; was undoubtedly the finest writer of whatever it was that he did that ever there was. He was a genius, an oddball, a madman. His stories&hellip; are without precedent." &mdash;[Neil Gaiman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman) [^gaiman-wapo]

> "Lafferty has the power which sets fire behind your eyeballs. There is warmth, illumination, and a certain joy attendant upon the experience." &mdash;[Roger Zelazny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Zelazny) [^cover-nine]

> "Lafferty’s Stories, like Philip K. Dick’s, are not susceptible to being confused with the work of any other writer.” &mdash;[Fred Saberhagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Saberhagen) [^cover-nine]

> "He is our most original writer&hellip; Just about everything Lafferty writes is fun, is witty, is entertaining and playful. But it is not easy, for it is a mingling of allegory with myth, and of both with something more" &mdash;[Gene Wolfe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wolfe) [^intro-episodes]

> “Wild, subtle, demonic, angelic, hilarious, tragic, poetic, a thundering melodrama and quest into the depths of the human spirit… R.A. Lafferty has always been uniquely his own man.” &mdash;[Poul Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Anderson) [^jabberwocky]

> “As with everything the man writes, the wind of imagination blows strongly, with the happy difference that in a novel he can reach full  gale-force. Lafferty defies categorization; his work is unlike anyone else’s." &mdash;[Harlan Ellison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Ellison) [^jabberwocky]

> "Lafferty unfailingly puts us, in his own words, ‘into a different juxtaposition with all things else in the world.’ Nobody else does it better. In fact, nobody else does it at all–not like this. Lafferty is one of a kind, a magician of strange images made fleetingly recognizable, of familiar emotions made strange and new and haunting. A delight.” &mdash;[Nancy Kress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kress) [^jabberwocky]

> “The history of the Choctaw Indians has been told before and is still being told, but it has never been told in the way Lafferty tells it…Hannali is a buffalo bull of a man who should become one of the enduring characters in the literature of the American Indian.” &mdash;[Dee&nbsp;Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Brown_%28writer%29) [^jabberwocky]

> "Lafferty belongs to a select group that includes James Joyce and Amos Tutuola, of writers who have reinvented the language of literature for themselves from the ground up &hellip; Lafferty has drawn strongly from the oral tradition of the American tall tale." &mdash;[Michael Swanwick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Swanwick) [^intro-iron]

> "You read a few of his stories and you begin to feel him rewriting your brain and opening new possibilities of what fiction, and science fiction especially, are capable of doing." &mdash;[Andrew Ferguson](http://bsuva.org/wordpress/2012/09/contest-winner-places-in-national-competition/) [^uva-prize]

> “It is a minor miracle that a serious philosophical and speculative work should be written so colorfully and so lyrically. There is, happily, no way to categorize the book: it has elements of science fiction, of pure fantasy, of poetry, of historical fiction." ---[Judith Merril](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Merril) [^jabberwocky]
